Simple Office Mac Removal Tool for removing Office 365/2016/2019

Since I have had to do this often in my life, I figured that rather than follow the official documentation from Microsoft I might 
as well create a script that would make things easier for all of the people who use Macs and encounter install/uninstall issues
with Office Products.

This is very much a simple script, but I highly recommend letting me know how it can be improved.

Thank you,

TODO:
Create a command line switch to move between complete removal and standard removal
Add file checking to ensure we have removed a directory/file so that we can ensure we have uninstalled.
Add a way to download the License Removal Tool so that when we run this uninstaller we don't have to segment the process into two halves.
